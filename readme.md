Traditional PageRank primarily relies on the quantity and structure of links, not the meaning or context of thoes links.
It can be manipulated by link farms and other spam techniques. 

This project aims to bring relvence-based search using NL. We apply semantic link analysis to understand the relationship between liunked pages.

With the help of **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**, we can learn the complex link relationships and predict the importance of nodes(website) in the graph.
